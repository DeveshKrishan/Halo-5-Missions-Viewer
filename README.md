# Halo 5 Missions Viewer

This was created using Python, HTML, and CSS. The tools I used were http.client, urllib, json, and flask. I grabbed the data using the first three
libraries and then used flask to render HTML templates that used the data from the Halo API and displayed them using webpages styled in CSS.

The Halo API can be found at https://developer.haloapi.com/docs/services/

Here is an image of the entire project!
